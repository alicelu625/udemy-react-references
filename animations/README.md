## Animations in React Apps

Introduces several ways to implement animation in React, which includes:

* CSS Transitions - uses props like transition, opacity, transform, etc.
* CSS Animations - allows for more complex & controll animation rather than transition prop to define more detailed set of steps to execute by using @keyframes to set different displays at different times & animation to define set of keyframes
* ReactTransitionGroup package - allows smooth animation of elements when added to or removed from the DOM
* Animating lists using subpackage TransitionGroup
